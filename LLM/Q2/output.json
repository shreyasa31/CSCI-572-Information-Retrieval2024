This problem does not occur when I run the operations synchronously.\n\n@Service\npublic class DemoService {\n\n    @Autowired\n    private ProcessService fileProcessingService;\n\n    // Asynchronously fetches a byte array and writes it to a file\n    public CompletableFuture<Void> processAndWriteFile(String id, String tag, String filename) {\n        return getAttachmentFileById(id, tag)\n            .thenCompose(zipBytes -> {\n                if (zipBytes != null) {\n                    return writeToFile(zipBytes, filename);\n                } else {\n                    CompletableFuture<Void> failedFuture = new CompletableFuture<>();\n                    failedFuture.completeExceptionally(new RuntimeException(\"Failed to retrieve bytes for ID: \" + id));\n                    return failedFuture;\n                }\n            });\n    }\n\n    private CompletableFuture<File> writeToFile(byte[] zipBytes, String filename) {\n        String tempDir = System.getProperty(\"java.io.tmpdir\");\n        File tempFile = new File(tempDir, filename);\n        return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {\n            try (FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(tempFile)) {\n                out.write(zipBytes);\n                return tempFile;\n            } catch (IOException e) {\n                logger.error(\"Failed to write zip file to disk\", e);\n                throw new RuntimeException(\"Failed to write zip file to disk\", e);\n            }\n        });\n    }\n}\n\n\nThe byte array fetched by getAttachmentFileById consistently logs the correct size. After passing the byte array to writeToFile, the file occasionally ends up shorter than the logged size. Question: Could this issue be related to how CompletableFuture manages threads or handles byte arrays? How can I ensure the entire byte array is written to the file consistently without data loss?\n\nAdditional Details: Occurs intermittently, more frequently under load.\n\njavaspring-bootasynchronousfile-iocompletable-future\nShare\nFollow\nasked 45 secs ago\nNew2Java\n2791\n1 gold badge\n6\n6 silver badges\n21\n21 bronze badges\nAdd a comment\nRelated questions\n930\nFile to byte[] in Java\n1011\nConvert InputStream to byte array in Java\n822\nJava: convert a byte array to a hex string?\n Load 5 more related questions\nKnow someone who can answer?
